# Express Yourself: Learn about AfterEffects expressions.

The goal was to create a website with useful visualisations of AfterEffects expressions, to learn more about what they are, the way they work and the outcome of combining some of them.

## See the website online:

You can find and use the website as a GitHub Page right here: [Express Yourself: Learn about AfterEffects expressions](https://flavieenrico.github.io/projet-perso).

## How I made the website:

In order to create the website, this [fullscreen slider template](https://ibrahima-ndaw.com/blog/fullscreen-slider/) was used, combined with more a basic html and css structure.
